As student of she.code, I want to learn how to use cd to navigate a directory tree through a funny and interesting game.

* setting up a project strucutre

* list of nice, but randomish names
* create a nice random tree
    * make sure it is not too deep
    * make sure it is not too wide
    * make sure it is not too shallow

* set a random start and targat position within the tree
* display instructions, explain challenge

* display tree
    * display a current working directory indicator
    * display the target position

* command line editor
    * research: is there something we can use?
        * look at how node is doing it    

    * cursor movement
        * left, right arrow keys
        * ctrl-e and ctrl-a
        * backspace
    * tab-key for auto complete
    * history
        * arrow up
        * reverse history search
    * prompt
        * display current path
        
* score system
    * figure out the least number of keystrokes required to get from start to target position (brute force approach?)

* a hint system
